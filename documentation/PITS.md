## Pits Folder
This folder contains the 3D scans of pits as '.glb' files, due to the number of polygons in each 3D object not all pits that were scanned are included in this folder. The pits included in this folder have been edited with a 3D editing software to limit the model to the pit area, some pits only had the pit face scanned, not all models have the same amount of detail or surface area captured.

While ArcGIS pro has multiple 3D object formats which can be imported '.glb' 3D objects have a file structure which is able to display both the surface/shape data and the material and shading data allowing for a much lighterweight process to introduce 3D objects into ArcGIS.
