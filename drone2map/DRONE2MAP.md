## Drone2Map Folder
#### Folder too large for github, can be found on boxdrive folder: https://iastate.app.box.com/folder/298784822202
This folder holds the geodatabases and products of the projects created when ArcGIS Drone2Map was used to compile maps from the UAS imagery. Drone2Map was initially used as it was readily available, OpenDroneMaps was then added in as a method of imagery processing due to it being opensource and more reliable at producing point cloud objects.
